## 🎯 Overview
DataGuard Pro is an intelligent voice-controlled assistant designed specifically for Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and legal professionals dealing with GDPR compliance. The system combines statutory law analysis with precedent-based assessment to provide comprehensive evaluations of potential data protection violations.

## 💡 Motivation
In today's data-driven world, organizations face increasing scrutiny regarding their data protection practices. Data Protection Officers need quick, accurate, and comprehensive tools to:

- Assess potential GDPR violations against both statutory requirements and real-world precedents
- Predict financial impact based on historical enforcement data
- Access relevant case law efficiently through intelligent search capabilities
- Make informed decisions about compliance strategies and risk mitigation

Traditional approaches require manual research through countless legal documents and enforcement databases. DataGuard Pro automates this process, providing DPOs with instant access to relevant precedents, statutory analysis, and financial impact predictions through natural voice interaction.

## 🏆 Hackathon Tracks

**🎙️ Track 2: Voice Agents powered by telli**
